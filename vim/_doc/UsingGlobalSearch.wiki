= Using Global Search =

== Create ID for global search ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In exVim, the global search use id-utils as the global search engine. Since the id-utils 
use a pre-generate index database for searching, it will be more efficient than grep/vimgrep.
You need to generate the database file --- ID first, you can use `:Up[date]` command. 
The command will create all files need for exVim, if you just want to create ID, try 
`:Up[date] ID` commands.

== Search text ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The global search provide two main method for search a word. The first one is using the 
`\gg` operation, which will search the word under the cursor. The second one is `:GS <word>`
which will search the `<word>` that user input.

When you are in global search select-window, you can press `<enter>` to jump to the result, 
meanwhile the exGlobalSearch will record the position to the exJumpStack, you can use `\tt` 
to check your stack result. And use `\tf`,`\tb` to move backward and 
forward from the next/last result.

== Concept ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically when you get some result from global search plugin, it will list in select/quickview. 
For instance, you global search 'TList' in a cpp project, and the result will like the 
picture below:

[[res\global.search.sections.png]]

As the picture show, we define some term for the item in the window. The concept 
is separate the result as file-section and preview-section so that we can apply 
filter in different sections. 

== Using the filter ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the concept we discussed above, when you get the search result, you can apply filter
to them to filter out the unwanted lines. To do this, you need to first apply a search 
pattern by use `/` or `#` and confirm the search. After that, you have several choice for
filter:

||*Operation/Command* ||*Explanation* ||
||`\r` ||Pick up results in {preview-section} matched the pattern you gived, and list them in quickview-window. ||
||`\d` ||Pick up results in {preview-section} unmatched patterns you gived, and list them in quickview-window. ||
||`\fr` ||Pick up results in {file-section} matched the pattern you gived, and list them in quickview-window. ||
||`\fd` ||Pick up results in {file-section} unmatched patterns you gived, and list them in quickview-window. ||
||`\gr` ||Pick up results in all sections matched the pattern you gived, and list them in quickview-window. ||
||`\gd` ||Pick up results in all sections unmatched patterns you gived, and list them in quickview-window. ||

You can use the filter again and again to get the exact result, that's the way we encourage 
people to do for search.
