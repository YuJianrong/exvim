= Details of patched-plugins =

== Intro ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section will introduce thoes vim plugin I modified. There have dozens of scripts
you can find in vim's official web-site. Some of them are great and popular in vim community.

I've been took a long time in selecting and evaluating vim scripts from the internet.
To make exVim simple, I only choose thoes scripts with functions or features that exVim 
didn't have. Also to make thoes scripts run well in exVim, I changed some of the code in
them.

Mostly I add `<esc>` mappings for thoes scripts have plugin window, so that user can close
thoes window as same as ex-plugins. Also I fix bugs and performance issues in some of them. 
Here are the patched plugin list, I'll introduce what I patched and my settings in vimrc in the
following sections.

    * [[MiniBufExpl]]
    * [[ShowMarks]]
    * [[TagList]]
    * [[LookupFile]]
    * [[VisualStudio]]
    * [[EchoFunc]]
